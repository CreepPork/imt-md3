The Intel Core i7-9750H is a high-end laptop processor. The processor clocks at 2.6 GHz and can execute up to twelve threads simultaneously thanks to Hyper-Threading. According to Intel, the CPU is manufactured in an improved 14nm (14nm++) process. Compared to the predecessor, the Core i7-8750H, the 9750H offers improved clock rates and a larger L3 cache.

Nvidia GeForce GTX 1660 Ti is built on TU116—an all-new graphics processor that incorporates Turing’s improved shaders, its unified cache architecture, support for adaptive shading, and a full complement of video encode/decode acceleration features. The GPU is paired up to GDDR6 memory, just like the higher-end GeForce RTX 20-series models.
Featuring concurrent execution of floating point and integer operations, adaptive shading technology, and a new unified memory architecture with twice the cache of its predecessor, Turing shaders enable awesome performance increases. 

DDR4-SDRAM with internal memory of 16GB and memory clock speed of 2666 MHz. The primary advantages of DDR4 over its predecessor, DDR3, include higher module density and lower voltage requirements, coupled with higher data rate transfer speeds. The DDR4 standard allows for DIMMs of up to 64 GB in capacity, compared to DDR3's maximum of 16 GB per DIMM.
