## have plenty of desk space
### Get yourself a monitor arm
I have three monitors and before I got the monitor arms, I had barely any space on my desk, which made any uni work where I have to write on paper a true pain

### Get a monitor light
While on the topic of desk space, there is no better way to save some space by removing a bulky desk lamp and adding a monitor light

Bonus points if it works via USB and you can save some mess on the cabling and plug it into your pc or even better into your monitor

## Some nice to haves
### XXL mousepad
also known as a desk pad, it improves the look of your setup tenfold, also if you have a wooden desk, like me, it can protect the desk from stains and spills

### backlit keyboard
this is more for the night owls out there, even though most people know the keyboard layout by heart, it's a nice to have in the dark, sometimes I start typing with an offset by a key to the left or to the right, somehow a backlit keyboard eliminates that issue, since I assume I subconciussly know where the keys are

### plants
maybe it's just me, but I do enjoy some greenery on my desk, it might not improve the air quality by much, but it definitely improves the look of a setup

### some rgb lights
People like shiny things, and LEDs are pretty cheap and usually can be turned on in the color that you like, sky's the limit with theese

## all together
These are the tips I can give to make a pretty cozy setup, here's a picture of my desk
