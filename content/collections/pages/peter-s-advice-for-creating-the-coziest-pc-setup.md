    <div id="one" class="virsraksts">
        <h2>have plenty of desk space</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="otrsVirsraksts"><h3>Get yourself a monitor arm</h3></div>
    <p>I have three monitors and before I got the monitor arms, I had barely any space on my desk, which made any uni work where I have to write on paper a true pain</p>
    <div class="otrsVirsraksts"><h3>Get a monitor light</h3></div>
    <p>While on the topic of desk space, there is no better way to save some space by removing a bulky desk lamp and adding a monitor light</p>
    <p>Bonus points if it works via USB and you can save some mess on the cabling and plug it into your pc or even better into your monitor</p>
    <div id="two" class="virsraksts">
        <h2>Some nice to haves</h2>
    </div>
    <div class="otrsVirsraksts"><h3>XXL mousepad</h3></div>
    <p>also known as a desk pad, it improves the look of your setup tenfold, also if you have a wooden desk, like me, it can protect the desk from stains and spills</p>
    <div class="otrsVirsraksts"><h3>backlit keyboard</h3></div>
    <p>this is more for the night owls out there, even though most people know the keyboard layout by heart, it's a nice to have in the dark, sometimes I start typing with an offset by a key to the left or to the right, somehow a backlit keyboard eliminates that issue, since I assume I subconciussly know where the keys are </p>
    <div class="otrsVirsraksts"><h3>plants</h3></div>
    <p>maybe it's just me, but I do enjoy some greenery on my desk, it might not improve the air quality by much, but it definitely improves the look of a setup</p>
    <div class="otrsVirsraksts"><h3>some rgb lights</h3></div>
    <p>People like shiny things, and LEDs are pretty cheap and usually can be turned on in the color that you like, sky's the limit with theese </p>
    <h2>all together</h2>
    <p>These are the tips I can give to make a pretty cozy setup, here's a picture of my desk</p>
